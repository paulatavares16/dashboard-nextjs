# Next.js Dashboard

This repository contains a dashboard project that I completed as part of the Next.js dashboard course available on nextjs.org. The main goal of this project was to enhance my understanding of Next.js and to gain hands-on experience with building a dynamic, responsive dashboard.

The application is deployed on Vercel and is available at [https://dashboard-nextjs-p16.vercel.app/](https://dashboard-nextjs-p16.vercel.app/).
